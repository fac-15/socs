## User stories 

"As a cotech website visitor, I would like to know which companies I can collaborate with" 

"I want to be able to see if a specific company is a member of cotech"

## Goals 

We set out to call the cotech API (that they are going to take away in a near future lol) from our server. 

- Make a function that displays the object on the website.

- Make a function to filter the object by organisation names 

- Make a dropdown list (TURNED OUT TO BE HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT)

## Things we learned 

We learnt that we've learned a lot these last four weeks lol. It felt good to be able to recap all of the previous weeks learning outcomes together.

## Things we're proud of 

![team work](https://media.giphy.com/media/lWeUm3HRhkhvG/giphy.gif) 

Team chemistry on poiiiiiiiiiiiint. 
We worked well together and made sure that everyone knew what everyone was doing/had done. 

We started out writing tests before anything else, unfortunately that fell apart as soon as we had issues with our code lol.

We figured out how to deploy to Heroku. The issue we had was that we needed a "start" : "node src/server.js" in our package.json.

## Stretch goals 

- Make an autocomplete searchbar 

- Testing with Nock

- More tests
